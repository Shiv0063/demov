              reducing the distance between Hazira(Surat and Ghogha(Bhavnagar) from 360km
              &amp;10-12 hours (roadways) to 90km &amp;4 hours (seaways) while giving cost
              effective travelling solutions to people. This project aims to take the amount of
              carbon footprint to a remarkable reduction by saving the exhaustion of fuel, and
              thus decongesting roads and lessening air pollution for environmental preservation.
              Our services will promote employment/business opportunities along with significant
              reduction in the travelling time, cost &amp; preserving the environment.</p>
